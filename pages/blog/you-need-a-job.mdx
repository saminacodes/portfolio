I am grateful to have experienced both perspectives during interviews. I've sat anxiously in the interviewee's seat, praying that I wouldn't be given a Leet Code hard level problem. On the flip side, I've also been on the interviewer's end, contemplating who I should bring on board to enhance our team.

Having experienced both sides, two truths have become apparent to me: First, I found myself more engaging when I had just about any sort of experience to talk about as long as I was passionate about it. Second, the most exceptional candidate was the one who had already been actively engaged in the work they would be hired to do.

Entering the tech industry and securing your first job can be an arduous task, but it tends to get easier once you get past the first one. From my own long winded road, I discovered that the trick was expanding the range of opportunities available to me.

Now, how does one go about achieving this?

The answer lies in your current life stage, and ultimately, it boils down to pursuing what genuinely interests you. Embrace as many compelling opportunities as possible in the early stages, allowing you to filter out the distractions and say 'no' to the noise later on.

I've categorized the types of opportunities into three paths:

1. The Student's Path
2. The Forgot-to-touch-grass Path
3. The Contributor's Path

Each path relies on how much you're willing to take risks and try new things.

## The Student’s Path

If you're still a student, count your lucky stars and make the most of it by joining student organizations that are organized around what you are passionate about. They don't necessarily have to be directly related to your future career; in fact, I encourage you to explore anything that draws you in. There will come a time when you'll be solely focused on your career, and it won't be as easy to find these exploratory opportunities.

When you become a part of these groups, be proactive and help with the areas or tasks you enjoy doing. I had my first taste of leadership by managing an Overwatch esports team for my university, and I included this experience on my initial resume. Through my involvement in the esports community, I also met someone who would later offer me my first paid job as a student IT employee.

Not only did I form lifelong friendships, but I also expanded my network of opportunities by being active in my local community

## The Forgot-to-touch-grass Path

Guess what, my friend? I've got some exciting news for you. The internet and social media (or should I say, "performative" media _cough_) are your ticket out. You have two options: build something or teach. The key is to share and put yourself out there.

My only advice here is the quality of your content will attract the quality of your audience. Focus on providing value. Ask yourself, will this post help someone? Instead of chasing cheap engagement, prioritize content that offers value.

When done right, there will come a point when you naturally cross paths with people who will propel you to the next level. You'll reinforce your own learning, connect with like-minded individuals, ignite your creativity, and future proof your career for years to come.

## The Contributor's Path

Now, here's the best part, and it's my personal favorite because it connects you directly with companies. Many tech companies offer programs designed to provide hands-on mentorship, skill-building opportunities, and a valuable addition to your resume. These programs are often low commitment and very flexible.

Keep in mind that each program is unique, and I'll continue updating this list to the best of my ability:

- Replit Reps
- Thirdweb Ambassadors
- Graph Advocates
- Polygon Advocates
- Microsoft Student Ambassadors
- AWS Community Builders
- Twilio Champions
- GitHub Experts

Once you're accepted into one of these programs, take a proactive approach. Ask how you can distinguish yourself, find out where the organization needs help, and identify the skills you're eager to learn.

Be open and honest about your intentions. For example, you can say, 'I want to enhance my public speaking abilities to pursue a career as a technical evangelist. Can you provide mentoring and help me access such opportunities?'

Often, the right program managers will be eager to assist you in achieving your career goals.

**Too long didn’t read (TLDR):** Each path requires a willingness to take risks and try new things. As a student, actively engage in student organizations around your passions. The internet and social media provide avenues for building something or teaching others. Focus on providing valuable content, attracting the right audience, and connecting with like-minded individuals. Finally, explore programs offered by tech companies that provide mentorship, skill-building, and resume enhancement. When you enter such programs, be proactive, express your intentions honestly, and take advantage of the opportunities available.
