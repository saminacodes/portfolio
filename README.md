## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This gets all our shit in order.
Next, we have to install SCSS.

## Install SASS

```
yarn add sass
```

####
## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
